        <p>I saw this artist in <em>New York </em> <br> outside of the Met.</p>
        
        <p>
            <img src="https://kufalo.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2ki-5.jpg" alt="Artwork by Oliver Kufalo" width="600" height="400">
            &nbsp; artist name: <a href = "https://kufalo.wordpress.com" > <i>Oliver Kufalo</i> </a>
        </p>  

        <p>
            His artwork has characterisitcs as follows
            <ol>
                <li>Ballerinas dancing in a spotlight</li>
                <li>A 3D aspect via thick paint coming forward off the canvas</li>
                <li>Occasionally colors <br> due to having a "colorful" spotlight instead of just white </li>
            </ol>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            I like Kufalo's work for several reasons
            <ul>
                <li>The  effect of the illuminated dancers against a black backdrop creates a dramatic visual experience</li>
                <li>His use of texture and light work together well</li>
                <li>Edgar Degas is one of my favorite artists
                    <br>-- and this seems to be a modern take on Degas' paintings created to capture the physicality of dancer
                    <br>-- although Kufalo's work is much more consistent in its direct frontal vantage point and has a very different style of painting</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
