        </p>  

        <p>
            Her work has characterisitcs as follows
            <ol>
                <li>Multifaceted artist:
                    <br>-- actress, singer, producer
                </li>
                <li>Entrepreneur:
                    <br>-- co-founded Rare Beauty, a makeup line that promotes mental health wellness
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mental health advocate:
                    <br>-- aside from Rare Beauty, Selena has collaborated with various mental health organizations and has engaged in public advocacy and awareness for mental health
                </li>
            </ol>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            I like Selena's work for several reasons
            <ul>
                <li>I grew up watching Wizards of Waverly Place, where she starred as Alex Russo</li>
                <li>She's known to be genuine and down-to-earth and is relatable to many people</li>
                <li>Her music is fun to listen to
                    <br>-- my favorite album of hers is her Revival album that I loved in middle school</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
